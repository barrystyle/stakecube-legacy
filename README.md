What is Stakecube (SCC) ?
-------------------------

Basic specifications for Stakecube; a Bitcoin 0.9 branch with PoS (proof of stake).

Premine is contained within block 1, a total of 250000 SCC, subsequent blocks being worth 25 SCC each until block 262800 (approximately one year into the future); where blocks solved via Proof Of Work no longer receive a reward.

Both Proof of Stake and Proof Of Work have their difficulty retargeting algorithms set for every 2 minutes.

Proof of Stake minting is set to reward users 100% per annum; or 6% per month.

Proof of Work mining is done via Lyra2Z.
